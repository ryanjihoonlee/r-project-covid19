# Exploratory Data Analysis on COVID-19 Dataset

## Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the virus's spread from an epidemic in Wuhan, China, to a global pandemic. The analysis examines the progression of confirmed cases worldwide, comparing the spread within China to the rest of the world and identifying key events and trends. The insights gained from this analysis help to understand the effectiveness of nationwide policies and the overall progression of the pandemic.

## Objective
The primary aim is to use linear regression techniques and visualizations to uncover patterns in the spread of COVID-19 and identify significant trends and events that impacted the transmission of the virus globally. 

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using the R programming language, utilizing various statistical and data visualization tools.

Packages used:

#### dplyr
#### ggplot2
#### readr

## Dataset
The dataset comprises confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, including specific datasets for cumulative confirmed cases globally, in China, and in other countries. Key variables include date, country, number of cases, and cumulative cases.
